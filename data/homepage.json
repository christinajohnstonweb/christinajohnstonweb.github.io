Don't fiddle with it all day. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.</p>"

It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Work that paint. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>"
